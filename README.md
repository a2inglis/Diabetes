Diabetes mellitus is a major chronic disease that affects millions of people around the world.  Diabetics are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from other causes.  Unplanned hospital readmissions are expensive to the system and waste healthcare resources.  More importantly, if a patient is readmitted within 30 days, the patient is not doing well and their quality of life is reduced.  The objective of this research is to try to predict which diabetic patients are likely to be readmitted to hospital within 30 days of discharge.  The dataset used in this analysis contains 101,766 patient records and 50 attributes, and it has diabetic patient hospital records between 1999-2008 from 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.  Patients were hospitalized for up to 14 days for various reasons and then some were subsequently readmitted. The dataset was retrieved from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
