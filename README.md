This study aims to predict hospital readmissions within 30 days for diabetic patients, a critical concern given the associated health risks and financial implications. Utilizing a dataset of 101,766 patient records from 1999-2008, obtained from 130 US healthcare facilities, the project involved the following steps: literature review, data preparation, outlier handling, feature encoding and selection, and model building and evaluation. The repository includes data exchanged between notebooks in each stage.
