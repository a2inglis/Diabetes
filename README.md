Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a pervasive chronic disease with significant implications for patients. DM increases the risk of other health issues and hospital readmissions.  Hospital readmissions are expensive to the system and patient quality of life is reduced. The objective of this research is to try to predict which diabetic patients are likely to be readmitted to hospital within 30 days of discharge. The original dataset contains 101,766 patient records with 50 attributes, from diabetic patient hospital stays between 1999-2008 from 130 US healthcare facilities. The dataset was retrieved from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
